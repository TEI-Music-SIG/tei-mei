TEI with Music Notation (MEI)
=============================

This is a collection of ODD documents to generate TEI with MEI XML schemas using Roma (command line only). Pre-generated RelaxNGs are included.

The MEI source is up-to-date with the 2012 release as of September 2012. *It has been altered to include internal prefixes to avoid conflicts with TEI elements with the same name*.
